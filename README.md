# Cat-vs-Dog-recognizer-by-Deep-Neural-Network
This project is on classifying images of cats and dogs with the help of deep neural network. This is my first project on Deep Learning. I got a very good metric for all the training,validation and testing accuracy. I have used images of cats and dogs as my data which has been taken from "KAGGLE".
